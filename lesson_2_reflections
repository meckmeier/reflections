What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a hidden directory is created where meta data about the files is stored.
you need to do it so there is somewhere to store meta data, so git can
start keeping track of changes to your files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
staging is totally controled by git... it gives git the ability to operate
directly on the the various files it needs.
