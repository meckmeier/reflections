How did viewing a diff between two versions hep you spot the bug?
Well if you imagine that you introduced some line that caused the old code to break, it
 it would seem helpful to find out what you changed.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  you could go back to old working versions of a program.
  What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
   commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
commits can be linked to logical changes in the file and thus easier to read.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  with code it is likely that you would have multiple files in a project, and
  that overhead isn't relevant for document management for the most part.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 use git log to get the list. it will give you the id which you can copy/paste
 to give to git diff to see the differences.
 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 because you can go back, you don't have to be afraid.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
storing my project files.
